The **Women's World Cup** is underway, and it is exciting.  Now that we are down to the Quarter-finals, we have some really good matchups coming:  

- Spain vs. Netherlands: this could go either way 
- Japan vs. Sweden: You have to like Sweden for this, but Japan has been very strong 
- England vs. Columbia: England are the favorites here, but Columbia have played very good, and have nothing to lose 
- Australia vs. France: France are higher ranked, but does Home Town advantage push Australia through?  

I, for one, can't wait for the action to pick up.
