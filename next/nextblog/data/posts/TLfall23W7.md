Well, week 7 was a bit of a bust... we had some serious matchups, but the weather would not hold.  

- Game 1: **Gecko vs. 3M** - Tight match - Gecko wins 3-2 - Change in top two spots  
- Game 2: **Aurora vs. Google** - Game did not start due to weather - May have a make-up game  

**Other matches:** 

- Amazon was getting trounced by PW Campbell 9-0 when the game got called 
- SAP game unknown 
- Duolingo game did not go ahead
