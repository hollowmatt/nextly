Here we are, **6 weeks in** to the season, and we are finally starting to get some separation in the top 4 teams (**Aurora** lost last week to Gecko, putting them in 4th with 9 points).  

**3M, Gecko, and Google** remain tied at the top with 12 points, separated only by goal differential.  

- **3M** - 1st place with a GD of 14 
- **Gecko** - 2nd place with a GD of 13
- **Google** - 3rd place with a GD of 11  
 
 This coming week (week 7) will see some excitement at the top as **3M plays Gecko** at 3:48pm, then **Google plays Aurora** at 5:24pm.  This will certainly shake up the top 4.
